        <p>Welcome to my project's page. Listed below are several of my projects that I've worked on. They demonstrate my knowledge of front-end development languages such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <div class="project-item">
            <a href="https://welcome-weather.surge.sh"><h3>Welcome Weather</h3></a>
            <p>Welcome Weather is intended to be a lightweight and simple weather application built using AngularJS. Intended to be used as a web browser's default home page, it automatically retrive's the weather based upon a user's geolocation data. </p>
            <p>Welcome Weather is a one page, multiple view application. The initial view renders as the current day's weather conditions with the other views ranging from 1 to 4 "days from now".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-item">
            <a href="http://anchorman-app.surge.sh"><h3>Anchorman</h3></a>
            <p>Collaborated with Kyle Holliday</p>
