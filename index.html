            <h3>Welcome Weather</h3> <a href="https://welcomeweather.surge.sh">welcomeweather.surge.sh</a>

            <a href="http://anchorman-app.surge.sh">anchorman-app.surge.sh</a>
            <p>Collaborated with Kyle Holliday</p>
            <p>Anchorman is intended to be a new social site for news. The site uses an API that feeds a stream of news agencies gathers them together in a single feed. It is a one-page, multi view site developed using AngularJS. </p>
            <p>From the main news feed, you are able to mark articles and save them to a list, viewable from a page in the navigation bar. On another view, users are able to build a list of topics and save the list so that articles in the feed are highlighted.</p>

            <h3>Olympic Adventures</h3>
            <a href="http://olympic-game.surge.sh">olympic-game.surge.sh</a>
            <p> Olympic Adventures was built using the BackboneJS framework and incorporates UnderscoreJS templates. It is a one page, multi view application. On the first view, users enter their name and select a vehicle.</p>
            <p>This application is a grid based game where users choose between two vehicles and move towards the next objective. Every time a user changes their position, they lose fuel and each objective they reach replenishes their fuel by a randomized ammount.</p>
            <p>Users must choose from one of two vehicles, where one has a larger starting fuel capacity than the second, but suffers from a tradeoff that it uses more fuel each move.</p>
            <p> </p>
